# COCO-Object-Detection-using-DreamAI
Using Single Shot Detection with Focal Loss implemented in DreamAI to train an object detection model on the COCO dataset.

DreamAI is an under development deep learning library written in Pytorch and inspired by FastAI.
This notebook is not a tutorial on DreamAI, it is just an example of how it can be used for object detection.
Stay tuned for a detailed overview/tutorial of DreamAI as well as other examples.

You can find the library here: https://github.com/fzaidi2014/dreamai

Any kind of feedback is much appreciated.
